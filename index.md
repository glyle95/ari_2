# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

This is Ari the Camel's blogsite. I started an [Instagram](https://deskgram.cc/adventuresofarithecamel) account in 2016 when I went to spend the summer in Israel.After the summer was over and I was back home in the United States, I decided to keep documenting my adventures!
